"""The files a reply names, for the bot to attach to that reply.

A turn that makes a file for the user (a letter PDF, a spreadsheet, a
figure) ends with a reply that names it: "the PDF is at
`~/.ea/letters/x/x.pdf`". The user reads that reply in chat, where the path
is no use. So after the reply is posted the bot attaches each file the reply
names, when all of these hold:

  * the reply gives a full path: absolute, or `~/` for the resident's home
    (the reply is the resident's, so its `~` is the resident's);
  * the file's type is one a person opens (ATTACH_EXTENSIONS), so a `.tex`
    source or a JSON state file beside the PDF stays a path;
  * the turn uploaded no file of that name itself (chat_upload.py or
    slack_upload.py --file) and the same bytes have not already gone to
    that thread;
  * the file was last changed during the turn and is no larger than
    MAX_ATTACH_BYTES.

The last check runs as the resident, on the descriptor the bytes are read
from (slack_outbox.materialize_for_owner with newer_than and max_bytes, and
no owner fallback). The owner never reads a named path with its own access,
so a reply can only bring the user a file the resident could already read
and post with chat_upload.py.

This module is pure text and bookkeeping: it opens no file.
