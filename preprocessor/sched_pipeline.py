"""The scheduling pipeline: code owns every number, the model picks and phrases.

One scheduling-channel request runs as fixed steps:

  1. locate   code finds the thread (search-mail by the names in the
              request) and takes a hit only when a name in the request is
              on that conversation's parties; the model is asked when
              several threads fit. Nothing is guessed: no name, no match
              or no answer is a `need`, a question for the user.
  2. intent   the model reads the request and the thread once and answers
              a JSON schema: who, how long, which dates, their time zone,
              what the sender prefers or ruled out, whether they named
              exact times, which mode (propose, validate, invite,
              reschedule, other) and, for an invite, the meeting title.
  3. solve    code builds the solver call from the intent (window dates,
              attendee time zone and stated days) and runs it. The solver
              labels every option with an id and each attendee's clock
              (sched_render). Exact times the other side named are
              checked first (validate-draft); when none is free, code
              proposes instead and the reply says so (a counter-offer).
              A window that yields nothing is retried without the CC'd
              attendees, then widened past a single day; the record says
              which. A request for "availability" lists up to eight
              options, two per day.
  invite      when the time is already agreed in the thread and the
              request asks for the invite: code builds the event (title,
              start, end, attendees, the institution's video link) and
              stages it for the Create button (sched_agent.live_write
              stage-event); nothing is created without the click. The
              time is the one the other side agreed to (named in their
              latest message, or the only one offered); several in play
              or a time already past is a `need`. "my calendar" with no
              one else stages a hold instead. A meeting already on the
              calendar at that time (an event there that names the other
              person or lists an invitee) is said, and nothing is staged.
  4. pick     the model sees the option lines with ids and answers a JSON
              schema: up to three ids, whether the sender's preferred day
              has one, an opening and a closing sentence with no clock
              time in them.
  5. check    code verifies the picks (valid ids, distinct days, inside
              the window, the preferred day used when it has an option,
              no clock in the prose) and repairs what it can.
  6. render   code assembles the reply from the option lines and the
              model's sentences (sched_render.render_body).

Shadow by default: the record goes to the store and nothing is written.
`live=True` creates the reply draft through sched_agent.live_write; the
bot's Send button stays the gate. Prompts are the defaults below or the
tuned set in <store>/tuning/sched-pipeline-prompts.json (sched_evolve
writes it); a caller can pass its own for a variant.

CLI:
  sched_pipeline.py run --text "Follow up with Sol with times that work that week" [--conversation-id <id>] [--live]
  sched_pipeline.py report [--days 14]

- sender_name, sender_email: the OTHER person in the thread, the one {user_first} is writing to. Never {user_first}'s own address.
- sender_timezone: an IANA zone (America/New_York, Europe/London) from their affiliation, signature or city; "" when nothing in the thread says where they are. A .edu in Massachusetts is America/New_York; northeastern.edu, mit.edu, harvard.edu, bu.edu are Boston.
- duration_minutes: 30 unless the request or the thread says otherwise.
- window_start, window_end: the first and last date (YYYY-MM-DD) a meeting may fall on, from the request and the thread ("the first week of November" is that week's Monday to Friday; "next week" is the week after today's). Empty when the mode is "other".
- preferred_days: dates (YYYY-MM-DD) inside the window the other person said they prefer ("Friday would be best"). A general "any day works" adds nothing.
- excluded_days: dates inside the window either side ruled out.
- offered_times: the exact clock times the other person proposed, as ISO date-times on {user_first}'s clock ("2026-11-03T14:00:00"); [] when they only named days or preferences. For "invite", the one agreed time.
- other_attendees: addresses of anyone else who must be on the meeting, besides the sender and {user_first}. Someone only CC'd on the thread is not an attendee unless the request or the thread says they attend.
- subject: for "invite", the meeting title as the thread names it (a short noun phrase, no date); "" otherwise.

Rules:
- picks: up to {max_picks} ids, on different days, earliest first. Honour the other person's preferred day when it has an option; otherwise say so in the opening.
- An option marked [ranked lower: ...] goes against one of {user_first}'s standing preferences. On a day that also has an unmarked option, pick the unmarked one; take a marked option only when its day has no other.
- preferred_day_available: true only when a pick falls on a day they preferred.
- opening: one or two sentences in {user_first}'s voice that introduce the times (and say plainly when the preferred day does not work). No clock times, no dates: the lines carry them.
- closing: one sentence asking them to pick one, in {user_first}'s voice ("Let me know which works and I will send a calendar invite."). No clock times.
