"""Daily digest of preference-rule changes, posted to the EA channel.

Every preference rule shapes what the EA surfaces or does, and the resident
can add one from a Slack message, so an email that steered the resident
could add a rule the user never asked for ("never show me X"). This is the
visibility layer: once a day it posts the rules added or retired since the
last run, so the user reviews them and can catch one he did not set.

It advances a cursor (preferences.py digest), so it reports each change once
and is silent when nothing changed. The first run seeds the cursor and posts
nothing. Idempotent and safe to leave in cron.
