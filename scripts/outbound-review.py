"""Post the daily outbound-web review to the EA channel.

Reads three logs, each from its own cursor (outbound_review.review):
fetch_url.py's log and the other modules' records in ea-bot space
(fetch-url.log), the owner-side log of the model's own WebFetch and
WebSearch calls (web_tool_log.py), and the owner-side log of requests and
remote-writer briefs from owner processes (outbound_log.py). Summarises
what left the machine and flags blocked fetches, exfil-shaped URLs and
searches, web tools in a cron lane, volume spikes, new hosts, many
subdomains, poll submissions under another name and any sign that the
ea-bot log was tampered with (see outbound_review). Posts once a day,
always a line (a short all-clear when nothing tripped), so the review is
visibly running.

With no cursor (a first run, or the file was removed) or a cursor that is
refused or is not JSON, each log is read from its start (bounded by size)
and the post opens with a LOG CHECK line that says why; a bad cursor is
set aside before the new one is written. No run skips a window silently.
A failed post does not advance the cursors, so a day is never skipped.
