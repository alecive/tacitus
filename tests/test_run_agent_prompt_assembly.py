"""Prompt-assembly smoke tests for run-agent.sh.

Bash performs backtick command substitution inside double quotes, so a
backtick in the double-quoted PROMPT string kills every agent at the
assignment under `set -e`, before Claude is invoked and before anything
posts to Slack. The eval suite judges model OUTPUT, so it passes while
the harness cannot assemble a prompt at all.

These tests evaluate the REAL prompt assignments extracted from
run-agent.sh through bash under the script's own `set -euo pipefail`,
once per agent skill file, and assert two things:

  1. the assignment evaluates (a substitution that DIES is caught), and
  2. every literal line of the string survives into the value verbatim
     (a substitution that silently SUCCEEDS, e.g. `date`, is caught by
     the mutated line even though the exit code stays 0).

A static no-unescaped-backticks check runs alongside, and a meta-test
re-injects a recorded offending line to prove this file flags it.

Note for prompt editors: the evaluation stubs every variable the prompt
interpolates. If you add a new ${VAR} to the prompt, `set -u` fails
these tests with "VAR: unbound variable" — add a stub to _stub_env().
Skill-file content is interpolated as ${SKILL_CONTENT}, and variable
expansion does not re-evaluate its value, so backticks in skills/*.md
are safe and deliberately untested here.
